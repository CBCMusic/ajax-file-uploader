# C# Ajax File Upload User Control

### Overview
 
This repo contains a standalone C# user control for adding Ajax file upload fields with progress bars to your web form. It contains 
a full Visual Studio .NET (2012) solution.

The control uses  LPology's excellent (Simple-Ajax-Uploader)[https://github.com/LPology/Simple-Ajax-Uploader] repo, which handles the bulk of the 
client-side work. The tool downgrades nicely for IE9 and below, which don't support file uploads via Ajax. 

More doc coming soon...
